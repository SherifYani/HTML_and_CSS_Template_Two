# HTML_and_CSS_Template_Two
This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development. I followed tutorials and exercises provided by " Osama El-Zero ", which helped me gain practical experience in HTML and CSS. The project showcases the implementation of various web design techniques, focusing on clean code structure and responsive design principles. It serves as a hands-on practice to solidify my understanding and improve my skills in front-end development.
